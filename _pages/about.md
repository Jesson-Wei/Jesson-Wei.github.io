I'm a fourth-year PhD student in machine learning at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Pan Li](https://sites.google.com/view/panli-purdue/home). My current research interests include **Machine Learning Trustworthy (Privacy)** and **Large Lanugage Model on Relational Data**.

Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree in Honors Math from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/).
